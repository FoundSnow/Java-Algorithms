Data Structures:
  Stack ( array (ar) or linked list (ll) ) (last in first out)
  Queue ( ar or ll) ( first in first out)
  Priority Queue ( ordered  ar) ( item with highest priority) 

Sorts:
  Bubble
  Selection
  Insertion
  Shellsort
  Quicksort
  Mergesort
  Heapsort
  
Red-Black Bianry Tree Rules:
  1) Every node is either black or red
  2) root is always black
  3) if a node is red, children must be black ( converse isn't neccisarrly true)
  4) Every path from the root to a leaf, or to a null child, must contain the same number of black nodes
  
  
Binary Trees:
  tree consist of nodes connected by edges
  tree is a type of graph ( unweighted and weighted graphs)
  adtvantges of a linked list and ordered array since search quickly like array and easliy insert and delete items like a linked list
  
Recursion:
  Method calls itself can be much more efficient and simple than for and while loops that repeaditly call the function.
